            18 years ago on May 10th a prodigy was born into this world and I was lucky enough to be born in the same
            hospital on the same day. Enjoy the beginning dialogue of the Bee Movie.
            According to all known laws
            of aviation,


            there is no way a bee
            should be able to fly.


            Its wings are too small to get
            its fat little body off the ground.


            The bee, of course, flies anyway


            because bees don't care
            what humans think is impossible.


            Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
            Yellow, black. Yellow, black.


            Ooh, black and yellow!
            Let's shake it up a little.


            I like video games


            Ooming!


            Hang on a second.


            Hello?


            - Barry?
            - Adam?


            - Can you believe this is happening?
            - I can't. I'll pick you up.


            I've always been in love with the idea of creating something out of nothing, which is why I took such a
            liking to programming


            Use the stairs. Your father
            paid good money for those.


            Sorry. I'm excited.


            Here's the graduate.
            We're very proud of you, son.

        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            A perfect report card, all B's.


            Very proud.


            Ma! I got a thing going here.


            - You got lint on your fuzz.
            - Ow! That's me!


            - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
            - Bye!


            Barry, I told you,
            stop flying in the house!


            - Hey, Adam.

            - Hey, Barry.

            Ma! I got a thing going here.


            - You got lint on your fuzz.

            - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
            - Bye!
